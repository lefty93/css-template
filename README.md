Please take notes that do not remove the fill color as he did. Removing Fill and adding strokes options in Figma, then copying as svg will give results like following: 

Instead, 
1. keep the fill color
2. don't add strokes (we will do it manually)
3. get outline stroke of filled text (no strokes!)
4. copy as svg

And you should get
<svg ...>
<path d="..." fill="..." />
<path d="..." fill="..." />
<path d="..." fill="..." />
<path d="..." fill="..." />
<path d="..." fill="..." />
<path d="..." fill="..." />
<path d="..." fill="..." />
</svg>

remove the fill property and add stroke="white" & stroke-width="5" to the path tags. The paths should look like
<path d="..." stroke="white" stroke-width="5" />

It is important that you remove the fill property or else the fill animation at the end won't work.
